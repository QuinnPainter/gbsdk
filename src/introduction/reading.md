# Required reading

To use GBSDK you best have a few other resources at hand.

- [Pandocs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/): The ultimate resource. Read this, memorize it. Read it again. Everything about how the hardware works is in here.
	And some things are essential to understand. Especially most of the rendering section (everything except the Pixel FIFO).
- Some kind of C tutorial. If you don't know how to program in C yet, you better get some basic understanding of what functions, variables, parameters, globals, locals, etc are. (still need some recommendation for the best tutorial)
